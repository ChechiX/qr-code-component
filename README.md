## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I want to highlight the part where I center the card with flexbox in the middle of the screen by stretching the body to achieve it.

```css
html,
body {
  height: 100%;
}

body {
  background-color: var(--slate-300);
  font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue learning about Flexbox and Grid to apply them in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Padding Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/padding) - This helped me because when I added padding, I didn't know where it was going.
